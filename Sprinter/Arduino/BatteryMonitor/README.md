### Overview
This is a purpose built battery/solar monitoring system.  It's goal is to track all Amps in and out of the system, including solar, van alternator, living area, and inverter.

### Screen decoder
(Yes, the fact that a decoder is needed is not good.  Apparently, I'm not a UI designer)

Before we get to the screens, a couple of things:
-  The "circuits" are: 0) Aux - low voltage panel for the living area, 1) Slr - solar panel, 2) Inv - Inverter, and 3) Str - Van starter battery and van alternator
-  The "time buckets" are: cur - real time value, min - last minute, hr - last hour, day - last day, and mth - last 30 days
