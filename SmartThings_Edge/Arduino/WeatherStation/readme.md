### Overview
This is a ESP based weather station commmunicating via WiFi with Samsung Smarththings Edge drivers which run on the hub itself.

It's intended to be self-sufficient with a solar panel and large capacitors for power.  Using capacitors came as an inspiration from: https://moteino.blogspot.com/p/5v-solar-power-supply.html?m=1

### Principles (of sort)
- All calculation and conversions done on the ESP.  Min/Max/Avg are done on the hub because there's more memory, and some capabilities already do this so it's more consistent.

### Basic Handshaking/Sync Flow

First Boot
1. ESP boots and has no way to contact the hub because the driver ports are unknown
1. ESP then puts itself into "handshaking mode" where it waits for a /handshake GET from the each hub driver.
1. The hub will notice that it hasn't hear from the ESP in the alotted time, and call /handshake
1. Handshake will set the epoch, ip and port for each driver
1. Handshake mode will continue until each driver (weather, wind, rain, and admin) have checked in via /handshake
1. Handshake mode is then exited and the ESP goes to deep sleep for the set amount of time (600 seconds?)

Each Wakeup  (like a new boot)
1. ESP checks to see if this is boot from deep sleep or first boot
1. Assuming it's a wake, ESP contacts hub with a GET call to /settings to retrieve the latest epoch and if it should go into wifi only mode
1. Sensors are read
1. Epoch (and wifi only flag) updated from hub using a GET message
1. Assuming its time, messages are posted to the hub
1. Note that the PMS sensor (air quality) only reads and post every hour because it's such a power hog

When Hub Port Changes (this happens when driver is updated or hub is rebooted)
1. ESP notices this condition by erroring out it's POST command
1. Once that happens, it goes into "handshake mode" where the ESP listens for /handshake
1. The hub will notice that it hasn't hear from the ESP in the alotted time, and call /handshake

### Logging
- Papertrail  (see logger.h for setup)

### Power Management
- The ESP and sensors are powered by three sources:
  - Solar panel connected via protection circuits to the capacitors to charge them
  - 2 Capacitors routed through a boost circuit (Adafruit MiniBoost 5V @ 1A - TPS61023), then connected to board via USB
  - A1000mAh LiPO battery connected via built in power/charging port on Fire Beetle board
- This particlar board (Fire Beetle) will charge the LiPO if USB power is over ~3.4 volts.
- All onboard voltage measurements are from the capacitors pre-boost circuit
- If cap voltage drops below certain thresholds, the following occurs based on DEFINES:
  - PMSMINVOLTAGE - Below this value, no further readings are taken from the PMS air sensor
  - SWITCHTOTOBAT - Below this value, boost circuit is disabled, leaving the battery to power things.  (this is because battery charging will drain the caps unecessarily)
  - SWITCHTOTOCAP - Above this, boost circuit is re-enabled - which will also charge the battery
  - POWERSAVERVOLTAGE - Below this value, long sleeps are enabled and no PMS reads are allowed.  
- The PMS air sensor is very power hungry (>120ma) so we minimize how often readings are taken.  (AIRREADTIME)

### ULP

### API Reference (server on ESP client)

- /handshake   (syncWithHub())
["hubAddress"]
["epoch"]
["deviceName"]
["hubPort"] - Hub port is always changing, so we need the latest  (this is for the device)

### Client side GET messages

- /settings  (syncSettings())
  ["epoch"] - Gets current epoch from hub (ESP does this periodically when it wakes up)
  ["wifionly_flag"] - When set (true/false), it puts the ESP in a mode where the WiFi is always on so that over-the-air updates can happen

### Capacity for 2x250F caps in series
- Approx 25mah capacity  (https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/capacitor-formulae.html)
	- Could perhaps extend this to 70mah by using a boost circuit  (this would support up to a 3.5ma draw for 18 hours)
- Target 1.5ma draw to work in the winter (6 hours of daylight)
	- We're drawing .15ma during sleep!!
